🔹 Step 1: Researched what makes a password strong

Learned about password complexity, importance of length, and role of character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).

🔹 Step 2: Selected a secure online password strength tool

Used Bitwarden Password Strength Tester (https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/) because it’s a modern, free, and secure tool.

🔹 Step 3: Created multiple passwords of different complexity levels

Examples:

Very weak password → 12345

Weak password → apple123

Good password → Apple123

Strong password → Apple@12345

Very strong password → A$pP!e_2025!Secure

🔹 Step 4: Tested each password in Bitwarden Password Strength Tester

Typed each password into the tool one by one.

🔹 Step 5: Collected screenshots of each password’s strength result

Captured results showing labels like:

Very Weak

Weak

Good

Strong

Very Strong (if achieved)

🔹 Step 6: Analyzed results from Bitwarden

Noted how:

Short passwords with only numbers or letters got “Very Weak” or “Weak”.

Longer passwords with mixed characters got “Good” or “Strong”.

Adding symbols and extending length significantly increased strength.

✅ Key Takeaways
Password length and complexity directly impact security.

Avoid simple or predictable passwords (like dictionary words, names, dates).

Use password managers for generating and storing strong, unique passwords.

Enable multi-factor authentication for extra security.

✅ Additional Insight from Testing Similar Passwords
During testing, I compared these two passwords:

password@123 → Weak

P@$$w0rd@123 → Strong

Even though both passwords contain the same basic word ("password") and numbers, replacing letters with similar-looking symbols (like using @ instead of a, $ instead of s, 0 instead of o) increased the complexity. This change makes it much harder for dictionary attacks or simple brute-force attempts to guess, because:

✅ Attackers relying on dictionary words won’t match creative symbol substitutions.
✅ Password checkers recognize this as greater entropy (randomness), improving strength ratings.

🔎 Why This Matters
Many people mistakenly believe adding a few symbols to a common word (like password123) makes it secure, but dictionary-based attacks with common substitutions can still guess weak variants.

However, unpredictable substitutions in multiple places, combined with length and additional symbols/numbers, greatly increases password strength.

For best security, avoid obvious words entirely or combine unrelated words into a passphrase.

During research for this task, I discovered that in the early 2010s, librarians in the U.S. raised concerns to Google about making two-factor authentication (2FA) mandatory for all Gmail accounts. These concerns were shared through letters and advocacy in library communities, highlighting important issues:

Many library patrons rely on public computers and don’t own mobile phones or personal devices required for 2FA.

Mandatory 2FA could lock out users who cannot receive verification codes or use authentication apps.

Librarians warned that forcing 2FA could increase the digital divide, disproportionately affecting low-income or marginalized populations who depend on library access for communication and essential services.

Google considered these points and decided not to mandate 2FA globally, instead focusing on gradual adoption and risk-based enrollment.
